        <p>Hey, I'm Chadano (formally known as MrBeeBenson).</p>
        <p>
            This is my little home on the internet where I like to show off things I have written or created! Here I will likely talk about myself, anything relating to open-source software and GNU/Linux ecosystems and anything relating to software (including software I create myself!)        
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a software developer and information activist, I seek to promote accessible, reliable information about free and open source software in my blog posts and write-ups. I am 18 years old, and I am very passionate about computers and technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            I first started learning website development in 2017 from school and fell in love with programming, from there I began to teach myself as much as I could. I was introduced to GNU/Linux and open source software in August 2020 and swapped from Windows 10 to Linux full-time in October 2020. I fell in love with open source software and the philosophy behind it.
